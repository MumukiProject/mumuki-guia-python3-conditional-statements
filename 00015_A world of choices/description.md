Now that we've covered several `if`s, let's go back to the function we started the lesson with:

```python
ãƒ  greet_to("Umi", 17)
"Good morning Umi"
```

Isn't it a little late to say _good morning_? :dizzy_face: Wouldn't it be better if `greet_to` did the following?

 1. If it's less than 12, say _Good morning_;
 2. **else**, **if** it's less than 7:00 p.m., say _Good afternoon_;
 3. **else** and at last, say _Good evening_.
 
ðŸŽŠ Yes, that's exactly what we want! Let's welcome the best friend of `if` and `else` statements: `elif`.

```python
def greet_to(who, hour):
  if hour < 12:
	  return "Good morning " + who
  elif hour < 19:
	  return "Good afternoon " + who
  else:
	  return "Good evening " + who
```

As we can see, with `elif` we can make a decision when the previous condition isn't met, and as the name suggests, it works like combining an `if` right after an `else`.
