The jury of a tournament asked us to develop a function `medal_for` that returns the medal for to the first places, according to the following logic:

* ðŸ¥‡ first place: it corresponds to `"gold"`;
* ðŸ¥ˆ second place: it corresponds to `"silver"`;
* ðŸ¥‰ third place: it corresponds to `"bronze"`;
* ðŸ˜… any other place: corresponds to `"nothing"`

```python
ãƒ medal_for(1)
"gold"
ãƒ medal_for(5)
"nothing"
```

> Define the function `medal_for` and test it in the console.
