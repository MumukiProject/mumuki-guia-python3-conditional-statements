ðŸ¥± So far, all of the functions we've written knew pretty precisely what they were going to receive and always did exactly the same thing - operate on two or more strings, do some arithmetic, evaluate a boolean expression, and so on. 

:alien: But in this lesson we will enter the world of the unknown, where programming makes even more sense. With the tool that we are going to learn, we will be able to solve new problems and avoid errors that until now we couldn't: depending on what we receive, we will be able to make different calculations, transform strings in different ways, and so on.

And how are we going to do that? By using the computer's ability to **make decisions**: the _conditional statement_, also known as `if`.
