ğŸ“› For an important conference, the organizers asked us to write name badges that each participant will have.

<div align="center">
    <img width="200px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mumuki/mumuki-guia-javascript-practica-funciones-y-tipos-de-datos/master/assets/name_badge.png">
</div>

To do this, we have to put together the participant's first name, last name, and job title into a single string.

> Define the function `write_badge`, which takes a first name, a last name and a job title, and composes a single string. For example:
>
> ```python
> ãƒ write_badge("Ana", "PÃ©rez", "Backend Developer")
> "Ana PÃ©rez, Backend Developer"
> ```
