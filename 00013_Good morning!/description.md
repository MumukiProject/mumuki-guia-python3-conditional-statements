The day has just begun :sunrise: and already we have to make a new function :sleeping:.

> ☀️ Define the `greetings_to` function that takes a name and greets the person with a classic _good morning_:
>
> ```python
> ムgreetings_to("Feli")
> "Good morning Feli"
> ムsay hello_to("Umi")
> "Good morning Umi"
> ```
