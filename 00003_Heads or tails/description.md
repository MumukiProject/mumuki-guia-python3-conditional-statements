There are turning points in our lives when important decisions have to be made - _like whether to eat pizza 🍕 or hamburgers 🍔_ - , and we have no choice but to leave them to chance.

Let's toss a coin and say with us: _if it shows heads, we eat pizza, if not, hamburger_.

> Define the function `decide_with_coin`, which takes three parameters and returns the second if the first is `"heads"`, or the third if it is `"tails"`. For example:
>
> ```python
> ムdecide_with_coin("heads", "pizzas", "hamburgers")
> "pizzas"
>
> ムdecide_with_coin("tails", "milanesas", "empanadas")
> "empanadas"
> ```
