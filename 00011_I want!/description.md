Ooops! 😰 Our opponent said _"Quiero!"_ - _I want_, in Spanish. That means our _envido_ bet has been accepted! ️:v: Now we have to take two cards and add up our total points to see who has more of them - and, of course, wins the bet. 😮

That's what we know:

* If the two cards are the same suit, the total _envido_ points is the sum of their individual _envido_ values plus 20.
* Otherwise, the total _envido_ points are equal to the highest _envido_ value among them.

For example: 

 * 1 sword and 4 swords sum 25 (1 + 4 + 20) points;
 * 2 cups and 3 clubs sum 3 points, because they are of different suits and 3 is the highest _envido_ value.



> Define the `total_envido_points` function that takes the ranks and suits of two cards and tells how many points they add up to. For example:
>
> ```python
> ムtotal_envido_points(1, "swords", 4, "swords")
> 25
> ムtotal_envido_points(2, "cups", 3, "clubs")
> 3
> ```
>
> Reuse the `envido_value` function you wrote in the previous exercise.
